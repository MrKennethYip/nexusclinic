              <!-- Text -->
              <p>I am a board-certified Chiropractor and Functional Integrated Acupuncture provider. I have a passion for staying active and challenging myself both physically and mentally. During my time at university and chiropractic college, I spent countless hours pursuing my powerlifting goals. In 2017, I had the opportunity to represent Canada in the International Powerlifting Federation’s World Championship in Belarus, bringing home several medals. This experience has not only improved my understanding of the physical capabilities of the human body, but also the relationship between physical and mental well-being.</p>
              
              <p>Outside of practice, I will take any opportunity to ride my motorcycle (‘06 VFR 800). I enjoy riding motorcycles as a way to unwind and clear my mind. I love the feeling of freedom and adventure that comes with riding and often take long trips on my motorcycle to explore new places and meet new people. I see my motorcycle as a way to connect with my own sense of identity and individuality, which I believe is important for maintaining a healthy work-life balance. </p>
              
              <p>As a chiropractor, I encourage my patients to find activities they enjoy that will help them stay physically active, mentally engaged, and motivated to achieve their health goals. I believe that a well-rounded approach includes not just physical care, but also personal interests and passions that contribute to overall well-being.</p>
              
              <p>My personal experiences with injuries have given me a unique perspective and understanding of the physical and mental toll that chronic pain can have on a person's life. I understand the frustration and disappointment that can come with being told to stop doing things that bring you joy. These experiences with such injuries have given me a deep appreciation for the physical and emotional impact of pain and injury.</p>
              
              <p>I believe that by teaching our patients about their bodies, how they work, and how it responds to their environment, they will be better equipped to manage their symptoms in the present and future. I encourage my patients to take an active role in their care and values their input and feedback. I know that the road to optimal health can be challenging, but I am committed to supporting you  every step of the way. Whether you're looking to alleviate pain, improve your mobility, or simply live a healthier life, I am here to help you achieve your goals.</p>

              <!-- Text -->
              <p>While I am well versed in addressing a wide spectrum of MSK conditions. I especially enjoy treating those with neck pain and headaches, shoulder pain, and upper/low back pain. These are all very common injuries that I have experienced myself, so I am able to truly relate and emphasize with you.</p>

              <!-- Text -->
              <p>I use a combination of functional movement assessment and physical examination to determine potential pain generators. Your plan of care is based on your specific needs as an individual, while utilizing a multi-modal approach to symptom management. This may look like a combination of exercise medicine, hands-on manual therapy, and a heavy emphasis on patient education.</p>
              
              <p>I specialize in corrective exercise and performance based rehabilitation, spinal and extremity manipulation, and soft tissue therapy. I am also a provider of functional integrated acupuncture.</p>

              <!-- End Title -->

              <!-- Text -->
              <p>As an evidence-informed practitioner, I consciously maintain my knowledge with the latest research surrounding many musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions, techniques in chiropractic care, and manual therapy. With my extensive knowledge of physical medicine and a focus on education, I strive to empower my patients with the tools they need to take control of their own health. I am most proud when I can help guide others in their own journey of living a healthy and happy life.</p>
              
              <p>My patient-centered approach means that I take the time to listen to your concerns and expectations. I then work together with you to develop a treatment plan so that I can continue to support you toward achieving your goals. I am also a firm believer in working closely with other healthcare providers to ensure that my patients' receive comprehensive and coordinated care.</p>

              </div>
              <!-- End Title -->

              <!-- Text -->
              <p>I am truly passionate about helping my patients achieve their health goals. I tailor each and every patient’s treatment plan with 3 concepts in mind: 1) to be evidence-informed in choosing appropriate modalities to best address your condition, 2) to provide patient-centered care taking into consideration your unique and individual circumstances, and 3) to include as much collaboration between the patient, myself, and other healthcare providers.</p>
              
              <p>I have over 8 years of experience in strength training and powerlifting, while having competed at the international level.  I had the opportunity to represent Canada as a junior at the 5th IPF World Classic Championship in Belarus. I successfully brought home Gold for the squat event (160kg/353lbs), Bronze for the deadlift event (177.5kg/391lbs), and Bronze overall with a total of 412.5kgs/909lbs.</p>
              
              <p>Currently, I am focused on engaging in a well balanced life, experimenting with various activities such as kickboxing, bouldering, and mindfulness.</p>
