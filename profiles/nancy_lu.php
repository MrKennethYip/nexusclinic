              <!-- Text -->
              <p>I graduated from Western University from the Masters of Physiotherapy program, where I focused my studies in orthopedics. I also graduated from the University of Toronto with an Honours Bachelor of Science degree, double majoring in Biological Sciences and Nutritional sciences. My strong background in Life Sciences has helped me elevate my clinical reasoning and develop a science-focused approach to my practice. I continued additional ongoing training in Manual Therapy, Soft Tissue Techniques, and Pelvic Floor Physiotherapy. </p>

              <p>I am highly skilled in orthopedic assessment and treatment for all musculoskeletal conditions, with a focus on neck, low back, and shoulder injuries. I have a unique approach in assessment that allows me to find the root of the problem. My treatments are focused on hands-on therapy, one-on-one in clinic exercising, and customized home exercise program.</p>

              <p>I am friendly, hardworking, and highly passionate about what I do. On my off hours, I like to garden and take care of my houseplants, go for long walks and discover new neighbourhoods, snowboard, and read about personal finances.</p>

              <!-- Text -->
              <p>The cases that I enjoy treating the most is low back dysfunction. I recognize that when my clients’ back issues are resolved, it significantly improves their quality of life. I love to educate my clients about the spine’s role as the scaffold and anchor for all movements of the body; without a stable base, movement cannot happen properly.</p>

              <p>Additionally, I am an expert at addressing issues at the level of the spine as the primary cause of a lot of common conditions of the hip, knee and feet, even when my clients did not notice a problem with their back before.</p>

              <!-- Text -->
              <p>I am most proud of continually challenging myself as a clinician. I continually reflect in my practice and strive to improve on my clinical reasoning and manual techniques. I am excellent in listening and responding to feedback from my clients. I am always seeking new opportunities to learn how to be better. I live by the saying, <em>“when something is becoming comfortable, make it uncomfortable.”</em></p>

                <h5 class="text-primary font-weight-bold">Why should patients choose you as their provider instead of others in the area?</h5>
              </div>
              <!-- End Title -->

              <!-- Text -->
              <p>Patients should choose me as their Physiotherapist instead of others in the Eglinton-Yonge area because I provide advanced hands-on care that is difficult to find anywhere else. I have adapted and transformed a unique set of manual skills that continues to be fine-tuned.</p>

              <p>I am also a highly visual and kinesthetic individual by nature. This allows me to better analyze and understand movement maladaptations and deficiencies in my clients. Which in turn, allows me to accurately assess and fix the root of the problem, using advanced hands-on treatment techniques, and a highly personalized home exercise program.</p>

              <p>Finally, I am a results-oriented clinician. I achieve this goal by actively listening and flexibly adapting to my client’s needs and goals. At the beginning of each session, I will ask my clients whether they are getting better, same or worse. I will then reassess and try to understand why they are progressing the way they are, and change the treatment plan accordingly. I provide my clients with a highly individualized progressive treatment plan that makes my clients feel like they will be able to achieve their goals in a timely manner.</p>
