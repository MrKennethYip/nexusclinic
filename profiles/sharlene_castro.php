              <!-- Text -->
              <p>Before becoming a Registered Massage Therapist, I received my Bachelor of Health Science degree in Kinesiology (with a specialization in Exercise Science) from the University of Ontario Institute of Technology. My university experience provided me with the opportunity to work closely with athletes and from there, I was introduced to sports medicine and the world of rehabilitation.</p>

              <p>In addition, my personal experience with injuries sustained during competitive sports and physical activity sparked my interest in understanding sport-related injuries and kinesthetics. And, ultimately, my passion for health promotion and massage. After obtaining my undergraduate degree, I completed my education in massage therapy at the Canadian College of Massage and Hydrotherapy (CCMH) and graduated with honours.</p>
              
              <p>In my free time, you can catch me on a badminton or tennis court, running a 5K on a track or trail, going on hikes or weightlifting. I’ve also got quite the palate; I love being introduced to new types of cuisines and trying my hand at emulating certain recipes.</p>

              <!-- Text -->
              <p>From the elderly, to prenatal populations, to office workers and students, I enjoy learning from and treating all ranges of musculoskeletal cases. However, due to my previous experience and training, I enjoy treating and working with athletes - some of which include pro-boxers and varsity badminton players. As a former athlete myself, I am able to empathize with their goals of self-care and returning to play.</p>

              <!-- Text -->
              <p>I like to incorporate myofascial release techniques as well as trigger point release therapy into all of my treatments. Essentially, both techniques assist in reducing pain and improving posture. </p>
              
              <p>In addition, I ensure that I am providing my patients with remedial home care, such as hydrotherapy modalities and/ or exercises to enhance the effects of massage therapy. I believe patient education plays a significant role in achieving short-term and long-term health goals. </p>

              <!-- Text -->
              <p>As a massage therapist, the greatest form of satisfaction is seeing a patient feel a sense of relief, even after just one treatment, in addition to, being able to be a part of that milestone on their journey to reaching their goals.</p>

              <!-- Text -->
              <p>I have a strong passion for patient education. With my patients, I walk them through what I find during assessment and treatment. I want my patients to understand their concerns, what structures are affected and potentially why issues occur, rather than just acknowledge it as pain. MY ultimate goal is to kickstart my patient’s inner drive to resolve their concerns and reach THEIR goals together.</p>
