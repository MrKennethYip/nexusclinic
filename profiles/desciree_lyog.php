              <p>Hello! My name is Desciree Iyog, a graduate from the Canadian College of Massage and Hydrotherapy. I became interested in pursuing Massage Therapy as a profession after a few personal treatments, as I was frequently involved in physical extracurricular activities that had caused injuries. I found that massage therapy was very pivotal to my recovery and is a very rewarding profession that can help others feel pain relief, and other benefits. I became very aware of this when I was working with rehabilitation patients while operating alongside the UHN Network in different units of Toronto Rehab and Bickle Centre—with clients ranging from MSK and Geriatrics to Stroke and Acquired Brain Injury units. The effectiveness of massage therapy within clients who have experienced varying extremes of pain or discomforts is a reward like no other. Being able to help relieve or maintain progress with any patient is something that I thoroughly enjoy, and I am honoured to become an aid towards optimizing rehabilitation, self-care, and wellness.</p>

              <p>I am an active individual who grew up playing volleyball all throughout my teenage years. I also indulge in dance classes at the Underground Dance Studio, and I am also another typical workout/gym junkie. I am very familiar with what these activities can do to—and for—your body. Consequently, I am aware of what structures can be affected with these activities with repetitive use, progressive overload, and what injuries may come about.</p>
              
              <p>Growing up in the Philippines in my primitive years, I was always surrounded by beautiful landscapes which grew my affinity for nature. I enjoy picnics, hiking, swimming, long walks with my dog, visiting beautiful locations, and taking photographs of picture-perfect sceneries. I am very keen on traveling more once the pandemic is over, and love hearing about hidden gems around the world.</p>

              <!-- Text -->
              <p>I like to treat different cases because I take every case as an opportunity to expand my knowledge and skills. In each condition, I give my best to make sure that I am able to improve my client's quality of life.</p>

              <p>I encounter all sorts of people as an RMT which have helped me widen my spectrum and variations in treatment. I find myself seeing many patients with sciatic nerve pain which has helped me gain a better understanding of the particular condition. I find that I am helpful in their rehab, which gives me more confidence to apply what I learn to each applicable patient.</p>

              <p>I am adaptable to the individual needs of any patient who comes under my care. With my training I am be able to help any person that I meet—if it is within my means and scope of practice. I will dutifully assess, treat, and reassess in every treatment to ensure that progress or maintenance is achieved under my care. I am an approachable individual that will prioritize the well-being of my patients with goals that I curate for you to understand what is necessary to attain the required results.</p>
              
              <p>At Nexus we pride ourselves in being reputable for our principles in treatment. This became the ideal clinic for me, since, I love to get to the root cause of one’s concern so that it’s lingering effects will soon subside. I give a warm and welcoming atmosphere in my treatment room, to ensure my clients feel safe and comfortable.</p>
